Introduction
============

plonetheme.basic is a Plone 4 theme.

plonetheme.basic is similar to plonetheme.sunburst -- styles were copied
from sunburst, and modified as outlined below. Appearances are very similar,
but this theme has been set up to be more easily customizable.

 * Uses base_properties, and some variables have been added for quick
   color customizations.
 * Goes back to table-based layout.
   (Not the best, I know, but it's so simple!)
 * CSS does not use !important, except for padding on content icons
 * Removed <img> tags from templates for icons. This is handled with CSS.
 * Cleaned up CSS selectors for efficiency
